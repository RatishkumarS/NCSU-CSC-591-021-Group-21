**1. Does SMO do better than the random baselines (see prints 1,2,4)?**

Answer: Yes, based on the outputs we got.We observed SMO does better than random baselines.This can be proved from the results.For example in the print 2.Top6 we got values like ['4341', '10', '20'] for weight,acceleration and mpg respectively [['4341', '10', '20']](https://github.com/RatishkumarS/NCSU-CSC-591-021-Group-21/blob/main/hw/w4/out/w4.out#L189) whereas for print 4 [['3085.25','12.925','20']](https://github.com/RatishkumarS/NCSU-CSC-591-021-Group-21/blob/main/hw/w4/out/w4.out#L192) and print 6[['3211','17','20']](https://github.com/RatishkumarS/NCSU-CSC-591-021-Group-21/blob/main/hw/w4/out/w4.out#L212) . The print results in 4 and 6 produced better results in terms of weight, acceleration and mpg which makes it clear that SMO does a better job than random baselines.
